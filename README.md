# IP-Test
Force close applications if your external IP has changed



I wrote this program to force close any applications that I was using if my external IP address changed. (You can modify the script to close other applications other than the 3 listed.)

It can be useful if you're using a VPN and you're suddenly disconnected without any prior notification - will force close programs using internet (safari, firefox, terminal) to protect your true IP address

Not the safest program in the world - but it does do its job. 
- Connects to a third party website to check your own IP. (I do not own neither operate that website, nor am I affiliated in any way with it)
- If the server does'nt reply right away (lag) it'll still force close any applications.
- Data leaks can still occur within the timeout periods.
